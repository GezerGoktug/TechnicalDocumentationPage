# TechnicalDocumentationPage
**<p>In this project, I created a technical information page about CSS. In the project, link tags were included that directed us to the relevant place when we clicked on the section in the left sidebar. The excess content was made visible with the scrollbar. In addition, the site was made tablet and mobile compatible.</p>**
